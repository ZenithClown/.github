## About this Repository

The `.github` is a special 🌟 repository 📃 that acts as a *fallback* for all other repository under an user or an organization [more information ℹ](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-use-the-dot-github-repository/). This repository is thus developed with all the necessary files, thus no special files are required at each individual repository. The following [community health files](https://docs.github.com/en/communities/setting-up-your-project-for-healthy-contributions/creating-a-default-community-health-file) are added (➕) here:

  * 🧰 [**Issue Templates**](.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE) for reporting any types of issues like 🐛`bug`, 🎉 `enhancement`, and ⚙ `new` features for any of the project.
  * 🔩 [**Pull Request (PR) Template**](.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md) is a simple representation to open a pull request in any of the projects associated in this organization.
  * 🖨 [**CODE OF CONDUCT**](.github/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) adheres to [Contributor Convent](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) that lists the code of conduct for all the open source projects in this organization.
